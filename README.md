# MakaMek

A cross-platform implementation of turn-based tabletop tactics BattleTech, built with .NET 9 and AvaloniaUI.

## Overview

MakaMek is an open-source tactical combat game featuring giant walking war machines. The game is inspired by another computer implementation of BattleTech called MegaMek but focusing on simplicity and accessibility for all the players. We try to keep gameplay as simple as possible and focus on mobile-first and web-first user experience.
